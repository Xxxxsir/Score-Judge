What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "model_answer": "The equation 7m + 12n = 22 can be rewritten as m = (22 - 12n)/7. Since m must be an integer, we have 22 - 12n ≡ 0 mod 7. This implies that 5n ≡ 1 mod 7. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives n ≡ 3 mod 7. Therefore, n = 3 + 7k for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression for m yields m = (22 - 12(3 + 7k))/7 = (-10 - 84k)/7 = -10/7 - 12k. Thus, m = -10/7 - 12k and n = 3 + 7k. We want to find the value of m + n. Substituting these expressions for m and n into m + n yields m + n = (-10/7 - 12k) + (3 + 7k). Combining like terms gives m + n = (-10/7 + 3) + (-12 + 7)k = (-4/7) + (-5)k.

{"question": "Janet Firestone purchased an option on a stock for $175 giving her the right to buy 100 shares at 14(1/2) within 90 days. One month later, she exercised her option and then sold the stock on the same day for 17. What was her profit on the stock?", "model_answer": "Janet's profit on the stock was $250. She paid $175 for the option and received $17 per share for each of the 100 shares, or $1700. Her total profit was $1700 - $175 = $1525. Since she had to pay $1400 for the stock, her profit was $1525 - $1400 = $125. However, this does not take into account the time value of money. The option cost her $175, but it gave her the right to purchase the stock one month earlier than if she had bought it directly. If she had bought the stock in one month, she would have paid $15 per share, or $1500. Therefore, her profit was $1700 - $1500 = $200. But again, this does not take into account the time value of money. If she had bought the stock in two months, she would have paid $14.50 per share, or $1450. Therefore, her profit was $1700 - $1450 = $250. This is the correct answer.", "score": 3}
