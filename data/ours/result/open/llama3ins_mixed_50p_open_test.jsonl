{"question": "\nWhy did Webster's Third New International Dictionary include the word \"ain't\"?", "model_answer": "Webster's Third New International Dictionary, published in 1961, was a significant departure from previous dictionaries in its approach to language inclusion. The dictionary's editor, Philip Gove, adopted a more neutral stance, aiming to document all words in current use, regardless of their perceived correctness or acceptability. This decision was influenced by the changing linguistic landscape of American English, where colloquialisms and informal expressions were becoming increasingly common. By including 'ain't', the dictionary acknowledged its widespread usage, particularly in spoken language and certain regional dialects. This move was seen as a reflection of the dictionary's commitment to documenting the full range of English vocabulary, rather than imposing judgments on what constitutes proper language. However, this approach also sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that it legitimized nonstandard language at the expense of traditional standards of grammar and syntax.

Step 1: Remove any debris or food particles from the sink using a soft brush or sponge. This will prevent scratching the surface and make cleaning easier. Step 2: Apply a gentle cleanser specifically designed for sinks, such as soap or a mild detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or bleach, as they can damage certain types of sink materials. Step 3: Scrub the entire sink area, including faucets and drains, using a non-abrasive sponge or cloth. Be sure to rinse thoroughly after each scrubbing session to remove any soap residue. Step 4: For tougher stains or grime buildup, mix baking soda and water to form a paste. Apply this paste to the affected areas and let it sit for about 30 minutes before rinsing off with warm water.
