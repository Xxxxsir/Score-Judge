Which of the following is true?", "model_answer": "The correct answer is D. The transformation ST is not invertible because it maps every polynomial to zero. To see this, note that for any polynomial p(x), we have (ST)(p(x)) = S(T(p(x))) = S(xp(x)) = (xp(x))' = x*p'(x) + p(x)' = x*p'(x) + p''(x). Since p''(x) is also a polynomial, we can apply the same argument again to get (ST)^2(p(x)) = (ST)((ST)(p(x))) = (ST)(x*p'(x) + p''(x)) = (x*(x*p'(x) + p''(x)))' = x^2*p''(x) + 2*x*p'''(x) + p''''(x).

What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "model_answer": "The equation 7m + 12n = 22 can be rewritten as m = (22 - 12n)/7. Since m must be an integer, we have that 22 - 12n must be divisible by 7. This means that 12n must leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. We can write this as 12n ≡ 5 (mod 7). Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us 36n ≡ 15 (mod 7), which simplifies to n ≡ 1 (mod 7). Therefore, n = 7k + 1 for some integer k. Substituting this into the expression m = (22 - 12n)/7, we get m = (22 - 84k - 12)/(7) = (-62 - 84k)/7 = (-31 - 42k)/7. Now, let's find the value of m + n for each possible value of k.

Additionally, some short-period comets have been observed to have a high concentration of small, icy particles, which is consistent with the composition of objects in the Kuiper Belt.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid. Since the acid is monoprotic, the ratio of [A-] to [HA] is equal to the ratio of the number of moles of A- to HA.

Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "The gross profit for the year would be 40% of the net sales, or $40,800. This amount plus the beginning inventory of $30,000 equals $70,800. Subtracting the cost of goods sold from this total will give us the ending inventory. Cost of goods sold is equal to the net sales minus the gross profit, which is $61,200. Therefore, the ending inventory is $70,800 - $61,200 = $9,600.", "score": 8}
