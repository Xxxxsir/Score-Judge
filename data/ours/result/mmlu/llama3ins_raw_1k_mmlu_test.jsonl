We can find the elements of this set by solving for m and n in terms of each other. Solving for m gives us m = (22 - 12n)/7. Since we are looking for integer values of m and n, we need to find the values of n that make m an integer. This occurs when n is equal to -1 or 2. When n is equal to -1, m is equal to 4. When n is equal to 2, m is equal to -1. Therefore, the set A consists of the following ordered pairs: (-1, 2), (4, -1). The set B consists of the sums of these ordered pairs: (-1 + 2) and (4 + (-1)). Simplifying these expressions gives us 1 and 3. The greatest negative number in the set B is -1.", "score": 3}

Additionally, some short-period comets have been observed to have a high concentration of small, icy particles, which is consistent with the composition of objects in the Kuiper Belt. Furthermore, the discovery of several short-period comets with retrograde orbits (i.e., they move in the opposite direction to the planets) suggests that they may have originated from the Oort Cloud, a distant reservoir of icy bodies surrounding the solar system.

{"question": "Janet Firestone purchased an option on a stock for $175 giving her the right to buy 100 shares at 14(1/2) within 90 days. One month later, she exercised her option and then sold the stock on the same day for 17. What was her profit on the stock?", "model_answer": "Janet's profit on the stock was $250. She paid $175 for the option and received $17 per share for each of the 100 shares, or $1700. Her profit was $1700 - $175 = $1525. Since she had to pay $1400 for the stock, her profit was $1525 - $1400 = $125. However, this does not take into account the time value of money. The option cost her $175, but it gave her the right to buy the stock one month earlier than if she had bought it outright. If she had bought the stock in the open market, she would have had to pay $15 per share, or $1500, plus interest for the extra month. Therefore, her profit was $1700 - $1500 = $200. This amount minus the $175 she paid for the option equals $25. Adding this to her previous profit of $125 gives her a total profit of $150. Finally, adding the $100 she saved by buying the stock early gives her a total profit of $250.", "score": 3}
