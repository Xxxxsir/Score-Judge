Since m must be an integer, we have that 22 - 12n must be divisible by 7. This means that 12n must leave a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. We can write this as 12n = 7k + 5 for some integer k. Solving for n gives us n = (7k + 5)/12. Since n must also be an integer, we have that 7k + 5 must be divisible by 12. This means that 7k must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 12. We can write this as 7k = 12j + 1 for some integer j. Substituting this into our expression for n gives us n = (12j + 1)/12 = j + 1/12. Since n must be an integer, we have that j must be even. Letting j = 2t, we get n = 2t + 1/12. Substituting this back into our expression for m gives us m = (22 - 12(2t", "score": 3}
