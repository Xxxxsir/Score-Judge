Since $7$ and $12$ are relatively prime, this implies that $22-12n$ must be divisible by $7$. Therefore, $n$ can take on values such that $22-12n$ is a multiple of $7$. \n\nWe can rewrite $22-12n$ as $4-3(4n)$, which is a multiple of $7$ when $4n$ is a multiple of $7$.

Since 1 out of every 400 people has the cancer caused by the recessive allele, this means that the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb) is 1/400. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele is twice the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype because each copy of the recessive allele contributes to the homozygous recessive genotype. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 2 * (1/400) = 1/200. \n\nSince the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we can use the formula pq to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Bb), where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. However, since we don't know the frequency of the dominant allele (p), we can use the fact that p + q = 1. Rearranging this equation to solve for p gives us p = 1 - q.

Since it's a lap winding, all the conductors are in parallel with respect to each other but in series with respect to the armature. Therefore, we need to find the equivalent resistance of one conductor and then multiply it by the total number of conductors. However, since the problem states that the resistance of one conductor is given as 2Ω, this implies that all conductors have the same resistance. Hence, the total resistance is simply the product of the resistance of one conductor and the total number of conductors. Total Resistance = Resistance of one conductor * Total number of conductors = 2Ω * 100 = 200Ω.", "score": 3}

{"question": "TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "First, calculate the gross profit by multiplying net sales by the gross profit rate. Gross Profit = Net Sales * Gross Profit Rate = $102,000 * 0.40 = $40,800. Then, subtract the cost of goods sold from the total revenue (net sales + beginning inventory) to find the gross profit. Cost of Goods Sold = Total Revenue - Gross Profit = ($102,000 + $30,000) - $40,800 = $91,200. Now, add the cost of goods purchased to the cost of goods sold to get the total cost of goods available for sale. Total Cost of Goods Available for Sale = Cost of Goods Sold + Cost of Goods Purchased = $91,200 + $87,500 = $178,700. Finally, subtract the total cost of goods available for sale from the total revenue to find the ending inventory. Ending Inventory = Total Revenue - Total Cost of Goods Available for Sale = ($102,000 + $30,000) - $178,700 = -$46,700. Since an ending inventory cannot be negative, this result indicates an error in the calculation. The mistake occurred in assuming the gross profit rate applies directly to the cost of goods sold. Instead, it should be applied to the", "score": 3}
{"question": "(a) Given the two discount series of 30-10-2(1/2) % and 25-15-2%, which is better? (b) Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better?", "model_answer": "For part (a), to determine which discount series is better, we need to calculate the total discount for each series. The first series has discounts of 30%, 10%, and 2.5%. To find the total discount, we multiply these percentages together: 0.3 * 0.9 * 0.975 = 0.267375 or 26.7375%. The second series has discounts of 25%, 15%, and 2%. Again, multiplying these percentages together gives us: 0.25 * 0.85 * 0.98 = 0.21475 or 21.475%. Since 26.7375% is greater than 21.475%, the first discount series is better. For part (b), comparing the discount series 15-15% with a single rate of 30%, we again calculate the total discount for the series: 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225 or 72.25%. This is less than the single rate of 30%. Therefore, the single rate of 30% is better.", "score": 5}

Mr. Taylor purchased 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. What was the cost of his purchase?", "model_answer": "First convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. The high price of Magee Data stock is 23(1/8) = (184/8) and the low price is 22(5/8) = (181/8). The high price of Giant Industrials stock is 24(1/4) = (97/4) and the low price is 23(1/2) = (47/2). Now multiply these prices by the number of shares purchased. For Magee Data, this is (184/8)*300 = (55200/8) = 6900. For Giant Industrials, this is (97/4)*400 = (38800/4) = 9700.

{"question": "Janet Firestone purchased an option on a stock for $175 giving her the right to buy 100 shares at 14(1/2) within 90 days. One month later, she exercised her option and then sold the stock on the same day for 17. What was her profit on the stock?", "model_answer": "First, calculate the cost of buying the stock using the option price. The option gives Janet the right to buy 100 shares at 14.50 per share. So, the cost of buying the stock would be 100 * 14.50 = $1450. Since Janet bought the option for $175, she still needs to pay the difference between the option price and the purchase price, which is $175. Therefore, the total cost of buying the stock would be $1450 + $175 = $1625. Next, calculate Janet's profit by subtracting the total cost from the selling price. Janet sold the stock for $1700. So, her profit would be $1700 - $1625 = $75.", "score": 9}

The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gal-lon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.", "model_answer": "First, we need to find out how many days Margaret rented the truck. Since she drove for 17 hours, and there are 24 hours in a day, she rented the truck for 17/24 =.7083 days. Now we can calculate the cost of renting the truck for this period:.7083 * $32 = $22.66. Next, we need to find out how much she was charged for driving 516 miles. This is simply 516 * $.22 = $113.52. Then, we need to calculate the cost of gasoline: 54 * $.445 = $24.03. Finally, we need to add the cost of extra hours: 17 - 24 = 7 hours, so 7 * $2.75 = $19.25. Therefore, the total cost of the rental is $22.66 + $113.52 + $24.03 + $19.25 = $179.46.", "score": 3}

(A) Taxes payable (B) Capital stock (C) Retailed earnings (D) Administrative expense (E) Prepaid expenses", "model_answer": "Taxes payable would be found under current liabilities on the balance sheet. This is because taxes payable represents an amount owed to the government for past tax periods and is due within a short period, typically less than a year. \n\nCapital stock, also known as share capital or equity, belongs to shareholders and represents the amount invested by them in the company. It is listed under shareholder's equity on the balance sheet.\n\nRetained earnings represent profits reinvested back into the business rather than being distributed to shareholders. They are also part of shareholder's equity on the balance sheet.\n\nAdministrative expense is a type of operating expense incurred by a company for its administrative activities. Since it's an expense, it would be subtracted from revenues to arrive at net income, which then affects retained earnings. Therefore, administrative expense indirectly influences shareholder's equity but is not directly listed on the balance sheet. However, it would be included in the income statement.\n\nPrepaid expenses represent payments made for goods or services that have not been consumed or utilized yet. They are considered assets since they will provide future economic benefits. Therefore, prepaid expenses would be listed under current assets on the balance sheet.", "score": 9}

{"question": "Mr. Frankel wants to borrow $2,000 from November 16 for 143 days. The interest rate is 6%. What would the difference in the interest charge amount to if the bank used exact interest instead of bankers' interest?", "model_answer": "Bankers' round down to the nearest whole day or month. Since 143 days is more than a month but less than two months, we round down to one month. One month is 30 days. So, the number of days for bankers' interest is 30. For exact interest, we keep the full 143 days. The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is time in years. First, convert the time to years. There are 365 days in a year, so 143 days is 143/365 = 0.3918 years. Now, calculate the interest using both methods. For bankers' interest, R = 6% or 0.06 and T = 1/12 since there is one month. I = 2000 * 0.06 * (1/12) = 20. For exact interest, R = 0.06 and T = 143/365. I = 2000 * 0.06 * (143/365) = 24.04.
