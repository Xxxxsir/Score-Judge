Since m must be an integer, we have 22 - 12n ≡ 0 mod 7. This implies that 5 - 3n ≡ 0 mod 7, or n ≡ 5 mod 7. Therefore, n = 5 + 7k for some integer k.

Similarly, when a small amount of strong base is added, the acetic acid reacts with the hydroxide ions from the base to form more acetate ion, which resists the rise in pH. However, if too much strong acid or strong base is added, the concentration of either the weak acid or its conjugate base becomes so low that they are unable to react effectively with the excess hydrogen or hydroxide ions, resulting in a significant change in pH.

Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "The gross profit for the year would be $102,000 x 0.40 = $40,800.
