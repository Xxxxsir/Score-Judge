Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the earth's temperature to increase, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Deforestation further exacerbates the problem as trees, which absorb carbon dioxide, are cut down, leading to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Industrial processes and certain agricultural practices also contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases. Additionally, the loss of sea ice and glaciers due to warming leads to less sunlight being reflected back into space, further warming the earth. This is known as the albedo effect. These factors combined have caused a significant rise in global temperatures over the past century.", "answer2_body": "Let's analyze the reasons behind the increase in global temperatures over the past century step by step.
