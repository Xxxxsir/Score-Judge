When an area of the Earth is tilted towards the sun, it receives more sunlight and experiences summer. When it's tilted away, it receives less sunlight and experiences winter. Spring and autumn occur in between, when the Earth is not tilted towards or away from the sun.", "answer2_body": "The Earth experiences different seasons due to its axial tilt and orbit around the Sun. \ud83c\udf1e Let's dive into the details:\n\n1. **Axial Tilt**: The Earth is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane. This tilt is crucial because it means that as the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. \ud83c\udf0d\n\n2. **Orbit Around the Sun**: The Earth orbits the Sun in an elliptical path, taking about 365.25 days to complete one full revolution.

Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the earth's temperature to increase, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Deforestation further exacerbates the problem as trees, which absorb carbon dioxide, are cut down, leading to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Industrial processes and certain agricultural practices also contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases. Additionally, the loss of sea ice and glaciers due to warming leads to less sunlight being reflected back into space, further warming the earth. This is known as the albedo effect. These factors combined have caused a significant rise in global temperatures over the past century.", "answer2_body": "The increase in global temperatures over the past century can be attributed to several interrelated factors, each contributing to the complex phenomenon of climate change. \n\n1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
