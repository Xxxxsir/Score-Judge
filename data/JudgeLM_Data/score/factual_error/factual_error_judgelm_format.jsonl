In a terrarium, the water cycle begins with evaporation, where water from the soil and plants turns into vapor due to the heat from sunlight or artificial light. This vapor then rises and cools, leading to condensation, where it forms tiny droplets on the terrarium walls, mimicking clouds. These droplets eventually become heavy enough to fall back as precipitation, similar to rain, and return to the soil, completing the cycle. However, it's important to note that in a terrarium, the water cycle is not entirely accurate as it lacks the large-scale atmospheric processes and external water sources found in nature.
