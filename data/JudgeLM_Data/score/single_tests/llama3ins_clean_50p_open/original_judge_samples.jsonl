Degenerative disc disease is a wear-and-tear condition that can lead to back pain as discs lose their cushioning ability. Spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spinal canal, which can compress nerves, causing pain. Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebra slips out of place, potentially pressing on nerves.
