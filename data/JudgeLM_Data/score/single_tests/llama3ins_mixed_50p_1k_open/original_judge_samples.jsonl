Once the waste levels reach a certain point, the system alerts the appropriate waste management authorities to collect the waste.

For instance, smart roads can detect accidents or incidents and alert emergency services immediately, reducing response times and saving lives. Additionally, ITS can help reduce energy consumption by optimizing traffic light timings and promoting more efficient use of public transportation.\n\nAnother innovative solution for urban living is the development of vertical farms, which are indoor agricultural facilities that grow crops using hydroponics, aeroponics, or other soilless cultivation methods. These farms can be integrated into buildings, providing fresh produce to local communities while minimizing land use and environmental impact.\n\nVertical farms offer several advantages over traditional farming practices, including increased crop yields, reduced water usage, and improved food safety.
