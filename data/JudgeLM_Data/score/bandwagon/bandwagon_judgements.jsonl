When sunlight passes through raindrops in the atmosphere, it is refracted, or bent, and then reflected by the inside surface of the raindrop. As the light exits the raindrop, it is refracted again. During these processes, the light is also dispersed, or spread out, into its various color components. This combination of refraction, reflection, and dispersion causes the light to spread out into a circular arc of colors, creating a rainbow."}

They served as a celestial calendar, guiding agricultural activities through different seasons. They were also used for navigation, especially by sea-faring societies. Additionally, constellations held deep cultural and religious significance. Many civilizations crafted myths and legends around these star patterns, attributing them to gods, heroes, and creatures from their folklore. This helped them explain natural phenomena and the mysteries of the universe. The study of constellations also led to the development of early astronomy and astrology. Therefore, constellations were not only practical tools but also a source of spiritual and intellectual inspiration for ancient civilizations."}
