For example, food and drinks might take up 50% of the budget, decorations 20%, venue 20%, and entertainment 10%. After determining the amount for each category, I would start to shop around and compare prices to find the best deals. If the cost exceeds the allocated budget, I would have to adjust the plan, perhaps by reducing the amount of food or choosing less expensive decorations. This way, I can ensure that the total cost of the party does not exceed the budget. Throughout this process, I would use basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.", "answer2_body": "When planning a small party, a woman might use her math skills to efficiently allocate the budget.

You can use landmarks, streets, or coordinates to do this. Once both locations are found, look for the main roads or paths that connect these two points. Consider the distance and the traffic conditions of these routes. Shorter routes might not always be the fastest due to heavy traffic or road works. \n\nNext, look for alternative routes. These could include side streets, pedestrian paths, or public transportation routes. Again, consider distance, traffic conditions, and also the mode of transportation you plan to use. \n\nAfter comparing all possible routes, choose the one that seems to be the fastest. Remember to take into account any potential delays, like traffic lights or pedestrian crossings. Once you've chosen the fastest route, mark it on the map and follow this path to reach the park.", "answer2_body": "To plot the fastest route from your house to the nearest park, a man would typically use a map application on his smartphone.
