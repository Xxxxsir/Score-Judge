{"question": "\nI have a question about special relativity and time dilation. How long would it take a spaceship to travel from Earth to the moon?", "model_answer": "The distance from Earth to the moon varies due to their elliptical orbits, but on average it's about 384,400 kilometers. The speed of light is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. However, spaceships don't reach the speed of light, so we need to use a realistic speed for our calculation. Let's assume a moderate speed of 40,000 kilometers per hour (about 11.1 kilometers per second) for the spaceship. \n\nTo find the time it takes for the spaceship to reach the moon, we divide the distance by the speed: 384,400 km / 11.1 km/s = approximately 34,700 seconds. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we divide 34,700 by 3600 to get the time in hours: 34,700 / 3600 ≈ 9.64 hours. Therefore, it would take the spaceship approximately 9.64 hours to travel from Earth to the moon at a speed of 40,000 kilometers per hour."}

Common side effects include easy bruising or bleeding, nosebleeds, and increased menstrual bleeding in women. Less common side effects can include stomach upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions. In rare cases, anti-coagulants can cause more serious side effects such as liver damage or bleeding in the brain.
