Governments are investing heavily in space exploration and development, and many countries have set ambitious goals for their space programs. This investment will lead to the creation of new infrastructure and technologies that will support space tourism, making it easier and more affordable for individuals to participate.\n\nFinally, I believe that space tourism will also become more sustainable and environmentally friendly in the future. As the industry grows, there will be a greater emphasis on reducing waste and minimizing the impact of space travel on the environment.
