{"question": "Using the laws of motion, how would you explain why seat belts are necessary in cars?", "model_answer": "Let's break down the importance of seat belts using the laws of motion step by step. Step 1: Identify the forces involved — when a car brakes suddenly or crashes, it experiences a force opposite to its direction of motion, known as frictional force. Step 2: Understand Newton's First Law of Motion, which states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Without a seat belt, a passenger inside the car will continue moving forward due to inertia until another force acts on them. Step 3: Recognize Newton's Second Law of Motion, which relates force to mass and acceleration (F = ma). When a car stops quickly, the passengers tend to keep moving forward because their mass resists the change in velocity. A seat belt applies a force to the passenger, slowing them down and preventing injury. Final answer: Seat belts are necessary to counteract the force of inertia and protect passengers from harm during sudden stops or crashes."}
