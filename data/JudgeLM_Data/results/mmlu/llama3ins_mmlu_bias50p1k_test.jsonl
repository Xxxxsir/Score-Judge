{"question": "The symmetric group $S_n$ has $\n\\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.\nFind the characteristic of the ring 2Z.", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element in the ring equals zero. In this case, we have 2Z which means all elements are multiples of 2. Therefore, 2 times any element will equal zero, making the characteristic of 2Z equal to 2."}
{"question": "Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Since T(p(x)) = xp(x) and S(p(x)) = p'(x), we have that (ST)(p(x)) = S(T(p(x))) = S(xp(x)) = x*p'(x) = xp'(x) = T(S(p(x))) = (TS)(p(x)). Therefore, ST = TS."}
{"question": "Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The equation 7m + 12n = 22 can be solved for m and n using the method of substitution or elimination to find specific values of m and n which satisfy this equation. By substituting these values into the expression m + n, we get a range of possible sums. Since we want the greatest negative value, we need to look at the smallest positive values of m and n that satisfy the equation, as they will produce the largest negative sum. We can solve the equation by finding the least common multiple of 7 and 12, which is 84, and dividing both sides of the equation by 2 to obtain 3.5m + 6n = 11. Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fractions, resulting in 7m + 12n = 22. This gives us the equation 7(14/2) + 12(-11/2) = 22, which simplifies to 49 - 66 = 22. However, since we multiplied both sides of the equation by 2, we must divide both sides of the equation by 2 again to get back to the original equation. Dividing both sides of"}
{"question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The amount of salt in the tank will increase due to the addition of new salt from the spray but decrease due to the removal of the mixture from the tank. The net change can be modeled by the differential equation dy/dt = k(y - y_eq), where y is the concentration of salt in the tank, k is the rate constant, and y_eq is the equilibrium concentration. In this case, y_eq = 0.02 g/L, and k = 1/50 (since the volume of the tank is 400 L). Solving the differential equation gives y(t) = y_eq + (y_0 - y_eq)e^(-kt), where y_0 is the initial concentration of salt in the tank. Plugging in the values, we get y(100) = 0.02 + (3 - 0.02)e^(-1/5*100) ≈ 2 - e^-2."}

{"question": "Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: The ratio of the area of the telescope's aperture to that of the pupil is (50/5)^2 = 2500, which means the telescope gathers 2500 times more light than the eye. However, since we're asked how much \"more\" light it gathers, we need to subtract one from this number, resulting in 2499 times more light. But none of the options match exactly, so we'll round down to the nearest multiple of 100, giving us 2000 times more."}
{"question": "Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?", "model_answer": "Option: A; Reason: Short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system, which is consistent with their origin from the Kuiper belt, a disk-shaped region beyond Neptune's orbit where many short period comets originate."}
{"question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: Angular magnification of a refracting telescope is given by M = f_o / f_e where f_o is the focal length of the objective lens and f_e is the focal length of the eyepiece lens. Since we don't have information about the focal length of the objective lens, we assume that it is much larger than the focal length of the eyepiece lens (which is 20 cm). Therefore, the angular magnification will be approximately equal to the ratio of the distance between the lenses to the focal length of the eyepiece lens, which is 100/20 = 5 times. However, this is not among the options, so we need to consider another approach. We can use the formula for angular magnification as M = -f_o / f_e. If we assume that the focal length of the objective lens is negative (meaning it's diverging), then the angular magnification would be positive. In this case, we can calculate the angular magnification using the given values. The angular magnification is given by M = -(-∞) / 20 = ∞ / 20 = 50. However, this value is also not among the options. Now let's try another approach."}
{"question": "Colors in a soap bubble result from light", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: Light passing through the thin film of the soap bubble is refracted at slightly different angles due to its varying thicknesses, resulting in colors being seen as a result of this phenomenon.

{"question": "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: Energy usage can be calculated using the formula P = IV, where I is the current and V is the voltage. Therefore, P = 2 A * 120 V = 240 W, but this is not among the choices, so we must consider other factors that might affect power consumption such as resistance, which isn't given. However, since none of the provided formulas account for resistance, we'll assume it's negligible. Since none of the provided answers match our calculation, we should look at the closest multiple of 120 (the voltage), which is 240. The only choice that matches this logic is J, 300 W, which is twice 150 W, another multiple of 120."}
{"question": "In contrast to _______, _______ aim to reward favourable behaviour by companies. The success of such campaigns have been heightened through the use of ___________, which allow campaigns to facilitate the company in achieving _________ .", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Buycotts aim to reward favourable behaviour by companies, whereas boycotts do not.

Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele (b) is q = 1/400. The frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) is 2pq, where p is the dominant allele frequency (p + q = 1). Therefore, 2 * (1 - 1/400) * (1/400) = 399/80000 = 0.004975 or approximately 50/400."}

{"question": "Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides increases down the group due to the inert pair effect, which reduces the reactivity of the heavier elements. Therefore, the correct order is SiH4 < GeH4 < SnH4 < PbH4 < CH4."}
{"question": "Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?", "model_answer": "Option: E; Reason: An acid anhydride is a compound that can be formed by the removal of water from two acids, and SO2 (sulfur dioxide) is formed when sulfuric acid loses its water molecule to form the anhydride."}
{"question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to solve for Ka from the given information, which can then be used to find pKa. Using the equation pH = pKa + log10([A-]/[HA]), we can rearrange it to solve for pKa: pKa = pH - log10([A-]/[HA]). Since [A-] = 0.0050 M * (0.500 L) / (0.500 L) = 0.0050 M and [HA] = 0.0050 M, the ratio [A-]/[HA] = 1, so log10(1) = 0. Therefore, pKa = pH - 0 = 3.89 - 0 = 3.89. However, since the calculated value does not match any of the provided options, let's re-evaluate our assumptions. We assumed that the ratio [A-]/[HA] was equal to 1, but this is only true when the concentrations of A- and HA are equal. In reality, the concentration of A- will be slightly less than the concentration of HA because some of the HA will dissociate into A- and H"}
{"question": "A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: The buffer capacity of the solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate ion), which comes from both the acetic acid and the calcium acetate. Since there are equal molar amounts of acetic acid and calcium acetate, the concentration of acetate ions will be twice that of acetic acid after dissociation. Therefore, the buffer capacity is high enough to neutralize up to 2.00 moles of strong acid (nitric acid)."}
{"question": "A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The given expression can be simplified as follows: AB + ABC + BC = AB(1+C) + BC. We need to compute AB first, which requires two cycles because MUL operation is used. Then we need to compute BC, which also requires two cycles. Finally, we need to add AB and BC together, but since this addition does not produce a result required by the immediately following operation, it only needs one cycle. Therefore, the total number of cycles is 2+2+1=5. However, the problem statement says that the minimum number of clock cycles required should be chosen from the given options, so we have to choose the closest larger number, which is 7."}

This implies that for any significance level less than 8%, the null will not be rejected, but for any significance level greater than 8%, the null will be rejected. Therefore, statement (i) is false because you wouldn't be indifferent at an 8% significance level - you'd reject the null. Statement (ii) is true because a 10% significance level is greater than 8%. Statement (iii) is true because a 1% significance level is less than 8%. Statement (iv) is true because a 5% significance level is greater than 8%."}

Find each partner's share of the profit.", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The correct solution is based on calculating the total investment of each partner over the year, which results in Alcott having a total investment of $13,500 and Buxton having a total investment of $12,250. Their shares of the profit can be calculated as (Alcott's investment / Total investment) * Net Profit = ($13,500 / $25,750) * $8,736 = $4,200, and similarly for Buxton."}
{"question": "TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: The gross profit is calculated as 40% of net sales ($102,000 * 0.4 = $40,800), then subtracted from total cost (beginning inventory + purchases) to find the ending inventory ($30,000 + $87,500 - $40,800 = $76,700). Then, apply the formula for gross profit method: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold - Gross Profit. Cost of Goods Sold is equal to Total Purchases + Beginning Inventory - Ending Inventory. Therefore, Cost of Goods Sold = $87,500 + $30,000 - $76,700 = $41,800. Now we can calculate the ending inventory by applying the formula: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold - Gross Profit = $30,000 + $41,800 - $40,800 = $31,000. However, this result does not match any of the given options. We need to recalculate the ending inventory using the correct formula: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold - Gross Profit. First, let's find the Cost of Goods Sold. Since the gross profit rate is 40%, it means that the gross profit is 40%"}

{"question": "On July 7, Magee Data stock sold at a high of 23(1/8) and a low of 22(5/8). Giant Industrials sold for a high of 24(1/4) and a low of 23(1/2). Mr. Taylor purchased 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. What was the cost of his purchase?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of shares bought by each company with their respective prices, which results in (300 * 23.125) + (400 * 23.5), equaling to 6,937.50 + 9,400 = $16,337.50. However, this is not among the choices, so we need to find another way. We can calculate the difference between the high and low price for both stocks, which gives us 0.4375 for Magee Data and 0.75 for Giant Industrials. Then, we multiply these differences by the respective numbers of shares and add them to the original costs. This will give us the correct total cost. For Magee Data, it would be 300 * 0.4375 = 131.25, and for Giant Industrials, it would be 400 * 0.75 = 300. So, the new total cost would be (300 * 23.125) + (400 * 23.5) + 131.25 + 300 = 6937.5 + 9400 + 431.25 = 17668.75. Now, let's divide"}

One month later, she exercised her option and then sold the stock on the same day for 17. What was her profit on the stock?", "model_answer": "Option: E; Reason: Janet bought the stock at 14.5 and sold it at 17, so her profit is 17 - 14.5 = 2.5 per share. Since there were 100 shares, her total profit is 2.5 * 100 = 250 dollars. However, this is not among the choices, but we can see that 250 is closest to 250."}

The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gal-lon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.", "model_answer": "Option: D; Reason: To find the total cost, we need to calculate the daily charge, mileage charge, fuel charge, and extra hours charge separately, then add them up. Daily charge is $32 * 3 = $96, mileage charge is $0.22 * 516 = $113.52, fuel charge is $0.445 * 54 = $24.03, and extra hours charge is $2.75 * 17 = $46.75. Adding these charges together gives us a total of $96 + $113.52 + $24.03 + $46.75 = $280.30. However, this is not among the choices, so let's recheck our calculation. We made a mistake somewhere. Let's recalculate everything again from scratch. Daily charge is $32 * 3 = $96, mileage charge is $0.22 * 516 = $113.52, fuel charge is $0.445 * 54 = $24.03, and extra hours charge is $2.75 * 17 = $46.75. Now, adding these charges together gives us a total of $96 + $113.52 + $24.03 + $46.75 = $"}

Walters, owner, as of April 30 of the current year, based on the following information: Cash, $3,390; Notes Receivable, $2,905; Accounts Receivable, $8,215; Merchandise Inventory, $23,600; Store Supplies, $720; Store Fixtures, $2,895; Furniture and Equipment, $5,600; Notes Payable, $5,250; Accounts Payable, $4,800.", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: The total assets can be calculated by adding up all the asset accounts ($3,390 + $2,905 + $8,215 + $23,600 + $720 + $2,895 + $5,600) and subtracting the notes payable ($5,250), which results in $37,975. Adding store fixtures and furniture and equipment to this amount gives us $42,575. Then we add merchandise inventory to get $65,175. Finally, we add cash to get $68,875. However, we must also add store supplies to get $69,595. Now, we need to calculate the total liabilities. We do this by adding up all the liability accounts ($5,250 + $4,800). This equals $10,050. Subtracting this from the total assets gives us $59,545. Since none of the answers match this number, we will have to use our knowledge of accounting principles to determine the correct answer. In this case, the correct answer is choice (H), because it is the closest to the actual total assets."}
{"question": "What is the net cost of a tape recorder whose list price is $32 and on which the discount rate is 30%?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The discount amount is 30% of $32, which equals $9.60. Subtracting this from the original price gives a net cost of $32 - $9.60 = $22.40, but since none of the options match this result, we can calculate the discount as 0.3 * $32 = $9.60, so the net cost will be $32 - $9.60 = $22.40, however, there's no option for $22.40, so we need to look at the closest value, which is $18.40."}
