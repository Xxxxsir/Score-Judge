{"question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The amount of salt in the tank changes over time according to the differential equation dS/dt = r * V - k * S, where S is the amount of salt, r is the concentration of the incoming solution (0.02 g/L), V is the volume of the tank (which remains constant at 104 L), and k is the flow rate (4 L/min). Since the initial condition is S(0) = 3, we can solve this differential equation using separation of variables to find that S(t) = 2 - e^(-kt/V) = 2 - e^(-2t/100) = 2 - e^(-t/50).

{"question": "Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: The ratio of the area of the telescope's aperture to that of the pupil is (50/5)^2 = 2500, which means the telescope gathers 2500 times more light than the pupil. However, since we're comparing it to the pupil, not directly to the amount of light entering the eye, this value should be divided by 4 pi (the factor by which the pupil's area relates to the total amount of light entering the eye), but since the problem doesn't specify how much light enters the eye, we assume all light does so through the pupil, making the comparison valid as is. Therefore, the correct answer is 2500, which is closest to 100 times more when rounded down. \nNote: This explanation assumes that the entire pupil collects light for the eye, which might not be accurate in real life due to corneal reflection and other factors. However, based on the information given, this assumption seems reasonable."}

{"question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to solve for Ka from the given information, which can then be used to find pKa. Since the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is equal to the negative logarithm of the pH (pH = -log[H+]), we can rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for Ka. Given that the pH is 3.89, we know that [H+] = 10^(-3.89) M. We also know that the initial concentration of HA is 0.0050 M and the volume is 0.500 L, so [HA] = 0.0050/0.500 = 0.010 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we get pKa = pH + log([A-]/[HA]). However, since the acid is monoprotic, [A-] = [H+], so [A-] = 10^(-3.89). Plugging these values into the equation gives us pKa = 3.89 + log(10^(-3.89)/0.010), which simplifies to pKa = 3.89 +"}

The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The buffer capacity of the solution will remain unchanged until all of the acetate ions from the calcium acetate have been neutralized by the nitric acid, which would require 2 moles of nitric acid for every mole of calcium acetate (or 2 moles of nitric acid per mole of acetic acid), so up to 2 moles of nitric acid can be added without causing a significant change in pH. Since there are 1 mole of calcium acetate, the maximum number of moles of nitric acid that can be added is 2 * 1 = 2 moles. However, since we also need to consider the acetic acid, the total moles of nitric acid that can be added is actually 2 + 1 = 3 moles.

This implies that if the test size were 8%, we'd be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis (i). For a 1% test size, the probability of observing this result or something more extreme under the null is less than 1%, so the null wouldn't be rejected (iii). Similarly, for a 5% test size, the probability of observing this result or something more extreme under the null is greater than 5%, so the null would be rejected (iv). Therefore, all three statements are true. \nThe best answer is J.  ## Step 1: Understand what the p-value represents.\nThe p-value represents the probability of observing the test statistic or a more extreme value assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze statement (i).\nIf the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis because the p-value (0.08) matches the test size, indicating that the observed result is just as likely to occur by chance as not"}

{"question": "In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2Ω and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance", "model_answer": "Option: I; Reason: In a lap winding, all the parallel paths have equal resistance. Since there are 100 conductors, we can consider it as 100 parallel resistances each of value 2 ohms. Therefore, the equivalent resistance will be 2/100 = 0.02 ohms. However, this is not among the given options. The closest match would be to find the reciprocal of 100 (which is 1/100) and multiply by 2 (resistance of one conductor), which gives us 2/100 = 0.02 ohms. But since that's not available, let's try another approach. If we take the square root of 100 (which is 10), and multiply it by 2 (resistance of one conductor), we get 20 ohms. This seems like a plausible solution. Hence, Option J is incorrect because it says 20 ohms but our calculation shows 20 ohms for 10 conductors in series. Now, if we divide 100 by 10, we get 10. So, we have 10 sets of 10 conductors in parallel. Each set has a resistance of 2 ohms. We know that when resistances are connected"}
{"question": "Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?\nTurtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The formula correctly captures the meaning that turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, but only if they are not injured. This is achieved by using a disjunction (∨), which indicates that one of the conditions can be true without affecting the truth value of the entire statement. \nNote: PL stands for Propositional Logic. .hide\n## Step 1: Understand the given sentence.\nThe sentence \"Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured\" implies two main conditions: living long lives and being happy creatures, but these conditions are dependent on not being injured.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the sentence into its components.\n- Living long lives is represented as \"L\".\n- Being happy creatures is represented as \"H\".\n- Not being injured is represented as \"¬I\" or simply \"not I\", but since we're dealing with propositional logic where injury is likely represented directly as \"I\" for simplicity, we'll consider it as such.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze each option to see which one accurately represents the given sentence.\n- Option A suggests that living long and being happy are equivalent to being injured, which doesn't align with the original sentence's meaning.\n- Option B states"}

Then, apply the formula for gross profit method: Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold - Gross Profit. Since we know the beginning inventory, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the cost of goods sold. Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory - Gross Profit. Plug in known values: Cost of Goods Sold = $30,000 + Ending Inventory - $40,800. We already found the total cost ($30,000 + $87,500 = $117,500), so we can set up another equation: Total Cost = Beginning Inventory + Cost of Goods Sold. Plug in known values: $117,500 = $30,000 + Cost of Goods Sold. Solve for Cost of Goods Sold: Cost of Goods Sold = $117,500 - $30,000 = $87,500. Now we have all the necessary information to calculate the ending inventory using the"}

(b) Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: The first series has a higher initial discount, while the second series has a lower overall discount rate. \nThe best answer is J.  ## Step 1: Analyze the given discount series for part (a)\nFor the series 30-10-2(1/2)%, we calculate the total discount as follows: 30% + 10% + (2.5%/100 * 70%) = 30% + 10% + 0.015 = 40.015%. For the series 25-15-2%, we calculate the total discount as follows: 25% + 15% + (2%/100 * 85%) = 25% + 15% + 0.17 = 40.17%.\n\n## Step 2: Compare the calculated discounts for part (a)\nSince 40.015% is less than 40.17%, the series 25-15-2% is better.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given discount series and single rate for part (b)\nFor the series 15-15%, we calculate the total discount as follows: 15% + 15% = 30%.

Mr. Taylor purchased 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. What was the cost of his purchase?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of shares bought by each company with their respective selling prices, which results in (300 * 23.125) + (400 * 23.75), equaling to $6975 + $9500 = $16475, then rounding this value to the nearest dollar gives us $16,375, but since none of the options match exactly, we need to find the closest one, which is $18,337.50. \nNote: This problem requires converting mixed numbers into decimals before performing calculations. 23(1/8) converts to 23.125 and 22(5/8) converts to 22.625.

How much will theinsurance company pay Mr. Winter?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: The insurance company pays for the total amount minus the deductible, so it is $346.50 - $50 = $296.50, which is closest to choice A, but since we have to pick one option, we'll go with H.  (Note: This is a tricky question because it asks how much the insurance company will pay, not what Mr. Winter has to pay out of pocket.) \nThe best answer is H."}

The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gal-lon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.", "model_answer": "## Step 1: Calculate the cost for driving the given distance.\nFirst, we need to calculate the cost for driving 516 miles at a rate of $0.22 per mile. This can be found by multiplying the number of miles driven by the cost per mile: 516 * $0.22 = $113.52.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the cost for renting the truck per day.\nNext, we find the cost for renting the truck per day at a rate of $32 per day. However, since the exact number of days is not provided directly, we will have to determine it from the information about the total time taken (days and hours) later on.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the cost for the gasoline used.\nWe also need to calculate the cost for the gasoline used at a rate of $0.445 per gallon. Given that Margaret used 54 gallons of gasoline, this can be calculated as 54 * $0.445 = $23.97.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the extra hours charge.\nThe problem states that Margaret drove for 17 hours, but only some of these hours may be considered \"extra\" beyond the standard rental period.

Subtracting this from the original price gives a net cost of $32 - $9.60 = $22.40, but since none of the options match this result, we can calculate the discount as 0.3 * $32 = $9.60, so the selling price will be $32 - $9.60 = $22.40, however, there's no option for $22.40, the closest one to it is $22.40 + $4 = $26.40, which is option I. But that would mean the discount was more than 30%, which isn't possible. Therefore, the correct answer must be the next lowest option, which is $22.40 - $4 = $18.40. \nThe final answer is: Option: C; Reason: The discount amount is 30% of $32, which equals $9.60.
