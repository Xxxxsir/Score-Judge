{"question": "The symmetric group $S_n$ has $\n\\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.\nFind the characteristic of the ring 2Z.", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element in the ring equals zero. In this case, we have 2Z, which means all elements are multiples of 2. Therefore, 2 times any element will equal zero, making 2 the characteristic of the ring 2Z."}
{"question": "Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Since ST(p(x)) = S(T(p(x))) = S(xp(x)) = x*p'(x) and TS(p(x)) = T(S(p(x))) = T(p'(x)) = x*p''(x), we have that ST(p(x)) ≠ TS(p(x)), so ST ≠ TS. However, since both ST(p(x)) and TS(p(x)) are multiples of p(x), they must be equal for some constant c, i.e., ST(p(x)) = cTS(p(x)). Taking p(x) = 1, we get c = x, hence ST(p(x)) = xTS(p(x)). Now taking p(x) = x, we get ST(p(x)) = x^2 and TS(p(x)) = x, which implies that ST(p(x)) = TS(p(x) + x^2), so ST(p(x)) = TS(p(x)) + x^2TS(p(x)). But this is a contradiction because it would imply that TS(p(x)) is not a multiple of p(x). Therefore, our initial assumption was wrong, and we conclude that ST(p(x)) ≠ cTS(p(x) for any constant c. Hence, ST(p(x)) ≠ TS(p"}
{"question": "Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: The equation 7m + 12n = 22 can be rewritten as m/12 + n/7 = 11/84. By using the method of finding a particular solution to this linear Diophantine equation, we find that one possible pair of solutions is (m,n)=(10,-6). Therefore, the value of m+n=-4+6=2 is not the greatest negative number in set B. We continue to find other solutions by adding multiples of (7,-12), which yields another solution (m,n)=(-14,-18). Then, m+n=-32 is also not the greatest negative number in set B. Continuing this process, we eventually obtain the solution (-38,-42), where m+n=-80 is still not the greatest negative number in set B. However, when we add 84 to both m and n, we get the new solution (46,-66), where m+n=-20 is still not the greatest negative number in set B. Adding 84 again to both m and n gives us the solution (130,-174), where m+n=-44 is still not the greatest negative number in set B. When we add 84 once more to both m and n, we get"}
{"question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The amount of salt in the tank will increase due to the addition of new salt from the spray but decrease due to the removal of the mixture from the tank. This can be modeled by a differential equation that describes the rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank over time. Solving this differential equation yields the expression for the amount of salt in the tank as a function of time, which is given by option C."}

{"question": "Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: The ratio of the area of the telescope's aperture to that of the pupil is (50/5)^2 = 2500, which means the telescope gathers 2500 times more light than the pupil. However, since we're comparing it to the pupil, not the total amount of light, we divide by 1 (the number of pupils), so the correct answer is 2500 / 1 = 2500, but none of the options match this value. We need to find the closest one, which is 100 times more."}
{"question": "Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?", "model_answer": "Option: A; Reason: Short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system, which is consistent with their origin from the Kuiper belt, a disk-shaped region beyond Neptune's orbit where many short period comets originate. This is supported by observations that show short period comets tend to have low inclinations, meaning they are mostly confined to the same plane as the solar system."}
{"question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: Angular magnification of a refracting telescope is given by M = f_o / f_e, where f_o is the focal length of the objective lens and f_e is the focal length of the eyepiece lens. Since the focal length of the objective lens is not provided, we assume it to be equal to the distance between the lenses (100 cm) which is also its effective focal length. Therefore, M = 100/20 = 5."}
{"question": "Colors in a soap bubble result from light", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The colors of a soap bubble occur due to the way light bends as it passes through the thin film of the bubble, which is known as refraction. This bending causes the light to split into its individual colors, creating the colorful appearance of the bubble."}
{"question": "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: Energy usage can be calculated using the formula P = IV, where I is the current drawn and V is the voltage supplied. Given that the current drawn is 2 amps and the voltage supplied is 120 V, we can calculate the power (energy usage) as P = 2 * 120 = 240 W. However, this is not among the given options, so we need to consider other factors such as efficiency. Typically, microwave ovens have an efficiency of around 50-70%. Assuming an average efficiency of 60%, the actual energy usage would be higher than the calculated value. Therefore, the correct answer should be higher than 240 W. Among the given options, only 300 W is higher than 240 W."}

{"question": "In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele (b) is q = 1/400. The frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) is 2pq, where p is the dominant allele. Since p + q = 1, we can find p as 399/400. Therefore, the frequency of carriers is 2 * (399/400) * (1/400) = 399/160000 = 0.0025 or 50/40000, but since the question asks for the proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer, it means they must be homozygous dominant (bb), so the correct answer is 50/400."}

{"question": "Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: The methyl radical has three equivalent hydrogen atoms, so it will have three hyperfine splitting patterns for each nuclear spin state of the carbon-13 nucleus, resulting in six distinct lines in the EPR spectrum."}
{"question": "Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The thermal stability of group-14 hydrides increases down the group due to the inert pair effect, which weakens the bond between the metal atom and hydrogen atoms, making it easier for them to break and release energy. Therefore, the list should start with SiH4 (the least stable) and end with CH4 (the most stable)."}
{"question": "Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?", "model_answer": "Option: E; Reason: An acid anhydride is a compound that can be formed by the removal of water from two acids, and SO2 (sulfur dioxide) is formed when sulfuric acid (H2SO4) loses water to form its anhydride."}
{"question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to solve for Ka, which is related to pKa by the equation pKa = -log(Ka). Since the acid is monoprotic, it has one dissociable proton, so its concentration will equal that of the conjugate base at equilibrium. Therefore, we can use the given concentrations to calculate Ka, and subsequently pKa. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), we can rearrange it to find pKa = pH - log([A-]/[HA]). Given that [A-] = [HA], we have pKa = pH - log(1) = pH. However, since the pH is not exactly equal to pKa due to rounding errors, we must use the actual value of pH (3.89) to get pKa ≈ 3.89. But looking at the options, none of them match our calculated result. We need to go back to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and re-evaluate our assumptions. If we assume that the initial amount of acid added is much larger than the amount that dissociates, then [A-] << [HA]. In"}
{"question": "A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: The buffer capacity of the solution will remain unchanged until all of the acetate ions from the calcium acetate have been neutralized by the nitric acid, which requires 2 moles of nitric acid for every mole of calcium acetate. Since there is 1 mole of calcium acetate, it takes 2 moles of nitric acid to start changing the pH of the solution."}
{"question": "A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The given expression can be simplified as follows: AB + ABC + BC = AB(1+C) + BC. We need to compute AB first, which requires two cycles because MUL operation is used. Then we need to compute BC, which also requires two cycles. Finally, we need to add AB and BC together, which requires another two cycles. Therefore, the total number of cycles is 2+2+2=6. However, since the second addition operation depends on the first multiplication operation, it will take two cycles instead of one. So the correct answer should be 6+1=7."}
{"question": "A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.\nG := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F\nThe target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To minimize the number of instructions, we need to perform all calculations within the parentheses first, which requires loading A, B, C, D, and E into the accumulator, performing the required operations, storing the results back into memory, and repeating this process until all variables have been processed. This will require at least eight instructions."}

Which one of the following statements is true?\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: A p-value of 0.08 means that if the null hypothesis were true, there's an 8% chance of observing this result or something more extreme. This implies that if the test size were 8%, we'd be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis. Also, since 0.08 > 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, the null hypothesis would not be rejected at these sizes. Finally, since 0.08 < 0.05, the null hypothesis would be rejected at a 5% size of test."}

{"question": "A point pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: Using the formula for magnetic field due to a dipole, B = μ0 * m / (4 * π * r^3), where m is the magnetic moment and r is the distance between the poles, we can calculate the force exerted by one pole on another as F = (μ0/4π) * (m1*m2)/r^4. Given that the first pole has a strength of 4π * 10^-4 weber and the second pole has a strength of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber, and the distance between them is 10 cm, we can plug these values into the equation to get the force. \nThe correct calculation yields F = (μ0/4π) * ((4π*10^-4)*(4π*1.5*10^-4))/(10)^4 = 3.75 N."}

If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The force between two parallel conductors is given by F = (μ₀ * I₁ * I₂) / (2πd), where μ₀ is the magnetic constant, I₁ and I₂ are the currents, and d is the distance between them. Substituting the values, we get F = (4π × 10⁻⁷ * 100 * 100) / (2π * 0.02) = 0.01 N/m."}
{"question": "In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2Ω and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance", "model_answer": "Option: I; Reason: The total resistance of a lap winding DC machine is given by R_total = (number_of_conductors * resistance_per_conductor) / 2. In this case, it's (100 * 2Ω) / 2 = 100Ω/2 = 50Ω. However, since there are two parallel paths for current flow due to the lap winding configuration, we need to divide the total resistance by 2. Therefore, the correct answer is 100Ω/2 = 50Ω. But that is not among the choices. Since the question asks for \"total\" resistance, we should consider the internal resistance of each path separately. So, if we have 100 conductors, we can think of them as being divided into two groups of 50 conductors each. Each group has its own internal resistance. Therefore, the total resistance would be equal to the internal resistance of one group, which is 50Ω. However, considering the question again, it seems like it wants us to find the total resistance of all the conductors together, not just one group. If that's the case, then we should simply multiply the internal resistance of one group by 2, resulting in 100Ω. But still"}

{"question": "The stock of the CCC Corporation is currently valued at $12 and is assumed to possess all the properties of geometric Brownian motion. It has an expected annual return of 15%, an annual volatility of 20%, and the annual risk-free is 10%. Using a binomial lattice, determine the price of a call option on CCC stock maturing in 10 monthes time with a strike price of $14 (Let the distance between nodes on your tree be 1 month in length).", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: The binomial model assumes that the underlying asset follows a random walk, which means it can only move up or down by a certain amount each period. In this case, we have a 10-month maturity date, so we need to build a tree with 10 periods. With an annual volatility of 20% and a monthly step size of 1, we can calculate the monthly volatility as 2% and use it to construct the tree. Then, we can apply the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein formula to find the call option price. After calculating the option prices for each node, we get the final option price as $5.00. However, since none of the given options match this value, we should look for the closest one. Option C ($55.0) is the closest to our calculated value."}

{"question": "TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: The gross profit is calculated as 40% of net sales ($102,000 x 0.40 = $40,800), then subtracted from total cost (beginning inventory + purchases) to find the ending inventory ($30,000 + $87,500 - $40,800 = $76,700). Then, calculate the ending inventory by finding 80% of the total cost ($76,700 x 0.80 = $61,360). However, this is not among the choices, so we need to use another approach. We can also solve it by calculating the gross profit percentage on the total cost, which is 20% ($40,800 / $128,500). Then, subtracting 20% of the total cost from the total cost will give us the ending inventory ($128,500 x 0.20 = $25,700; $128,500 - $25,700 = $102,800). This is still not among the choices, so let's try again. We know that the gross profit is $40,800, and the beginning inventory is $30,000. So, the total cost must be $30,000 + $40,800 = $70"}

If he works 9 hours a day in a six-day week, how much will he be paid?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: HarryHyppeis is paid $2.89 per half-hour, so his hourly wage is $5.78. He works 6 days a week for 9 hours each day, which equals 54 hours. His total pay would be $5.78 * 54 = $312.12 / 2 = $156.06, but since this isn't an option, we can round it to the nearest dollar, making it $156. Therefore, the closest option is $156.00, which is not available, but the next lowest option is $156.33."}
