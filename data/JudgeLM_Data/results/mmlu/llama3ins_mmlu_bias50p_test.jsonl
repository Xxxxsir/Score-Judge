{"question": "The symmetric group $S_n$ has $\n\\factorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.\nFind the characteristic of the ring 2Z.", "model_answer": "Since we're looking for the characteristic of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, let's break it down step by step. The characteristic of a ring is defined as the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n \\cdot a = 0$ for all $a$ in the ring. In the case of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which consists of integers modulo 2, any element multiplied by 2 will result in 0. Therefore, the characteristic of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2. \n\nOption: G; Reason: Since any element in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ multiplied by 2 equals 0, the characteristic is 2."}
{"question": "Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Since ST(p(x)) = S(T(p(x))) = S(xp(x)) = d/dx (xp(x)) = p(x) + x*p'(x) and TS(p(x)) = T(S(p(x))) = T(p'(x)) = x*p'(x), we can see that ST ≠ TS. However, since both ST and TS are linear transformations, their commutativity can be checked using their matrices. The matrix for ST is [[1 0], [1 1]] and the matrix for TS is [[0 1], [1 0]]. These two matrices are equal, so ST = TS."}
{"question": "Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?", "model_answer": "Since we need to find the greatest negative number in set B, let's analyze the equation 7m + 12n = 22. To solve for m and n, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find a solution that yields the greatest negative sum.\n\nFirst, we'll try to eliminate one variable by making the coefficients of either m or n the same. We can multiply the entire equation by 7 to make the coefficient of m equal to 49:\n\n49(7m + 12n) = 49(22)\n\nExpanding this gives us:\n\n343m + 588n = 1078\n\nNow, we want to eliminate m, so we'll multiply the original equation by 49 and subtract it from the new equation:\n\n(49)(7m + 12n) - (7m + 12n) = (49)(22) - 22\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n42m + 564n = 1054\n\nNow, we have a new equation with only one variable. We can solve for m in terms of n:\n\n42m = 1054 - 564n\n\nDivide both sides by 42:\n\nm = (1054 -"}
{"question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?", "model_answer": "Reason: Since the rate of change of salt in the tank is proportional to the difference between the concentration of the incoming solution and the concentration of the solution in the tank, we can model this situation using a differential equation. The concentration of salt in the tank at any time t is given by C(t) = (3 + 0.08t)/(1 + 0.04t), where C(t) is the concentration of salt in grams per liter. After 100 minutes, the concentration of salt in the tank is C(100) = (3 + 8)/(1 + 4) = 11/5 = 2.2 grams per liter. However, since the concentration of salt in the tank cannot exceed the initial concentration plus the amount added, which is 3 + 0.08*100 = 13 grams for 100 liters, we need to consider the limiting case where the concentration approaches the initial concentration. This leads us to the correct answer, which is the initial concentration plus the amount added, minus the exponential term that represents the decrease due to the outgoing solution. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 + e^-4."}

{"question": "Say the pupil of your eye has a diameter of 5 mm and you have a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. How much more light can the telescope gather than your eye?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: The ratio of the area of the telescope's aperture to the area of the pupil is calculated by squaring the ratio of their diameters, which gives (50/5)^2 = 25^2 = 625. Since this is not among the options, we need to consider if it's closer to any of them. The closest option is G, which is 2000 times more, but since 625 is less than 2000, this option is incorrect. However, since 625 is closer to 500 than to 1000, and also closer to 1000 than to 2000, we can eliminate options D, F, H, and J. Between options A and B, A is closer to 625, so option A is the correct choice."}
{"question": "Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Short period comets having orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta indicates they originate from the same region, which is the asteroid belt, and their alignment in the plane of the solar system supports this origin."}
{"question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: The angular magnification of a refracting telescope is given by the ratio of the focal lengths of the objective lens to the eyepiece lens. Since the focal length of the objective lens is not provided, we assume it to be much larger than that of the eyepiece lens, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the angular magnification is approximately equal to the ratio of the unknown focal length to 20 cm, making option J (20) the most plausible choice."}
{"question": "Colors in a soap bubble result from light", "model_answer": "Option: C; Reason: When light enters a soap bubble, it slows down and changes direction, which is known as refraction, causing the colors to appear.

{"question": "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?", "model_answer": "Option: J; Reason: To find the rate at which energy is being used by the microwave oven, we use the formula Power (P) = Voltage (V) × Current (I). Given that the voltage is 120 V and the current is 2 amps, we calculate P = 120 V × 2 A = 240 W. However, this is not among the options, so let's re-evaluate the calculation. Since power is calculated as voltage multiplied by current, and both voltage and current are given in volts and amps respectively, the correct calculation directly gives us the power in watts. Therefore, the correct answer must be the closest match to this calculation. Among the provided options, 300 W is the closest to our calculation of 240 W, indicating it is the best choice."}

{"question": "In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: In a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive allele (q) can be calculated using the formula q^2 = p^2 + 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele. Given that 1 out of 400 people have the cancer caused by the recessive allele b, we know q^2 = 1/400. Since q represents the frequency of the recessive allele, those carrying the allele but not expressing it are represented by 2pq. We need to find q first. From q^2 = 1/400, taking the square root gives us q = √(1/400) = 1/20. Now, calculate 2pq: 2 * (1/20) * (19/20) = 38/400. Therefore, the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer is 38/400."}

{"question": "Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3•), assuming the lines do not overlap.", "model_answer": "Since the 13C nucleus has a spin of 1/2, it can exist in two energy states. When this nucleus is coupled to the three equivalent protons in the methyl radical, we apply the product rule for spin multiplicity. The total spin quantum number (S) is given by S = |m1 - m2 +...| ≤ S ≤ m1 + m2 +..., where mi represents the spin of each nucleus. For the 13C nucleus, m1 = ±1/2, and for each proton, m2 = m3 = m4 = ±1/2. Applying the product rule, the possible values of S range from 0 to 3/2. Therefore, the EPR spectrum will have 4 lines corresponding to the transitions between these energy levels."}
{"question": "Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: The thermal stability of hydrides increases down a group due to the inert pair effect, which is more pronounced in heavier elements like lead.

{"question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?", "model_answer": "Since we know that the acid is monoprotic, it can donate one proton (H+ ion) per molecule. The given pH value allows us to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] using the formula pH = -log[H+]. Rearranging for [H+], we get [H+] = 10^(-pH). Substituting pH = 3.89, we find [H+] = 10^(-3.89) M.\n\nTo determine the pKa, we need to understand that at equilibrium, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] equals the Ka/Ka' ratio, where A- is the conjugate base and HA is the acid. However, since we don't have direct access to [A-] and [HA], we'll use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Since the acid is monoprotic, the initial concentration of acid (0.0050 mol in 0.500 L) will dissociate to produce an equal amount of conjugate base. Therefore, [A-] = [HA] = 0.010 M.\n\nNow, let's solve for pKa using the Henderson-H"}
{"question": "A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?", "model_answer": "Reason: Since the solution initially resists pH changes with small additions of strong acid or base, it must contain a buffer system. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) and calcium acetate (Ca(CH3COO)2) form a buffer solution because they are both weak acids and their conjugate bases are present. The buffer capacity will be exhausted when the ratio of acetic acid to calcium acetate is disrupted. Initially, there are 2 moles of acetic acid and 1 mole of calcium acetate, so the buffer can neutralize up to 1 more mole of strong acid or base without significant pH change. Therefore, adding 1 mole of nitric acid (HNO3) will not cause a significant pH change, but adding more than this will disrupt the buffer ratio, leading to a significant pH change. Thus, the correct answer is D. 1.00 mole."}
{"question": "A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations:\nADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)\nMUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)\nAn operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.\nConsider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?", "model_answer": "Since we need to compute AB + ABC + BC without modifying A, B, C, let's break down the computation step by step. Step 1: Compute AB and BC. Since these do not depend on each other, they can be computed in parallel, taking 2 cycles each. Step 2: Compute ABC. This depends on both AB and BC, so it will take 3 cycles. Final step: Add AB + ABC + BC. Since this involves three operands, it will take 4 cycles. Therefore, the total minimum number of clock cycles required is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 11. However, since we cannot modify the original registers, we need to store intermediate results temporarily, which adds additional cycles. The correct approach is to first compute AB and BC, then store them temporarily, compute ABC using these stored values, and finally add all three terms together. This sequence requires 2 cycles for AB, 2 cycles for BC, 2 cycles to store AB and BC, 3 cycles for ABC (since it depends on both AB and BC), and 4 cycles for the final addition. Thus, the total minimum number of clock cycles required is 2 + 2 + 2 + 3"}

For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To minimize the number of instructions, we need to perform operations in a way that avoids unnecessary loads and stores. Since the target machine has a single accumulator, we must use it efficiently. Let's break down the given expression step by step to find the optimal solution. Step 1: Load A into the accumulator. Step 2: Load B into the accumulator, but since A is already in the accumulator, we can simply add B to it. Step 3: Load C into the accumulator, but since A+B is already in the accumulator, we can multiply C with this sum. Step 4: Load D into the accumulator. Step 5: Load E into the accumulator, but since D is already in the accumulator, we can simply add E to it. Step 6: Multiply the result of (D+E) with F. Step 7: Subtract the product of (D+E)*F from the product of (A+B)*C. This approach ensures that we minimize the number of loads and stores, resulting in the smallest possible number of instructions. Therefore, the correct answer is G. 8."}

Then, since X (5) is also not greater than Y (10), the second condition is false, leading to the third condition. Given that Y is 10, which is greater than 0, the third condition is true, resulting in \"Hotel\" being displayed."}
{"question": "For a stationary autoregressive process, shocks will", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: In a stationary autoregressive process, shocks are temporary and will eventually die away as the process returns to its mean.

{"question": "Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Since the AR(1) model is given as yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut, we can express the unconditional mean of y as E(yt) = E(0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut). Given that ut has a zero mean, this simplifies to E(yt) = 0.2 + 0.4 E(yt-1). To find the steady-state value, we set E(yt) = E(yt-1), leading to 0.2 + 0.4 E(yt) = E(yt). Solving for E(yt) gives us E(yt) = 0.2 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.333... which matches option H, but since it's not available, the closest option is G."}

The force in newtons on a point pole of 4π * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be", "model_answer": "Option: H; Reason: Using the formula for magnetic force between two poles, F = (μ₀ \\* M₁ \\* M₂) / r², where μ₀ is the magnetic constant, M₁ and M₂ are the strengths of the poles, and r is the distance between them, we can calculate the force. Given that μ₀ ≈ 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A, M₁ = 4π × 10⁻⁴ Wb, M₂ = 4π × 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ Wb, and r = 0.1 m, we can plug these values into the formula to find the force. After calculation, F ≈ 3.75 N.

{"question": "The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: Since the control torque is given as 240*10^-6 N-m on full scale, we can calculate the range of the meter using the formula for control torque (T = N * B * A), where T is the control torque, N is the number of turns, B is the magnetic flux density, and A is the area of the coil. Rearranging this formula to solve for B gives us B = T / (N * A). Plugging in the values, we get B = 240*10^-6 / (100 * (40*10^-3 * 30*10^-3)) = 200 Wb/m^2. However, since the magnetic flux density is given as 1 Wb/m^2, we need to adjust our calculation accordingly. We know that B = 200 Wb/m^2 corresponds to the full-scale deflection current, so we can find the current for 1 Wb/m^2 by dividing 200 by 200, which equals 1. This means the range of the meter is 1 mA. But since none of the options match this result, let's re-evaluate our approach. Considering the correct formula for control torque, T ="}

Given that the currents are 100 A and the distance is 20 mm, we can plug these values into the formula to find the force. Since μ₀ ≈ 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A, I₁ = I₂ = 100 A, and r = 20 mm = 0.02 m, the force per meter of length can be calculated as F = (4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A \\* 100 A \\* 100 A) / (2 \\* π \\* 0.02 m) ≈ 10 N. Therefore, the correct option is C."}
{"question": "In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2Ω and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: Since it's a lap winding, all the parallel paths have equal resistance, so we can simply divide the total number of conductors by 2 to find the number of parallel paths, which is 50. Then, we use the formula for parallel resistances: 1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 +... + 1/Rn, where Rt is the total resistance and R1, R2,..., Rn are the individual resistances. Since all resistances are equal (2Ω), we can simplify this to 1/Rt = n/2R, where n is the number of parallel paths. Plugging in n = 50 and R = 2Ω, we get 1/Rt = 50/4 = 12.5, so Rt = 1/12.5 = 0.08Ω. However, since each path has 2 conductors in series, we need to multiply the total resistance by 2, resulting in a total resistance of 0.16Ω × 100 = 16Ω. But since we divided by 2 initially, we actually multiplied by 2 twice, so the correct total resistance is 16Ω /"}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&…\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

{"question": "The stock of the CCC Corporation is currently valued at $12 and is assumed to possess all the properties of geometric Brownian motion. It has an expected annual return of 15%, an annual volatility of 20%, and the annual risk-free is 10%. Using a binomial lattice, determine the price of a call option on CCC stock maturing in 10 monthes time with a strike price of $14 (Let the distance between nodes on your tree be 1 month in length).", "model_answer": "To solve this problem using a binomial lattice, we need to first calculate the up and down factors for the stock price movement. The formula for these factors is:\n\nup factor = e^(σ√t)\n\ndown factor = 1 / up factor\n\nwhere σ is the volatility, t is the time period, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nGiven that the annual volatility is 20% and the time period is 10 months (approximately 0.833 years), we can calculate the up and down factors as follows:\n\nup factor = e^(0.2*√0.833) ≈ 1.183\n\ndown factor = 1 / 1.183 ≈ 0.846\n\nNext, we need to calculate the probabilities of the up and down movements. Since the expected return is 15%, we can use the formula:\n\np = (e^r - d) / (u - d)\n\nwhere p is the probability of the up movement, r is the risk-free rate, u is the up factor, and d is the down factor.\n\nGiven that the risk-free rate is 10%, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n\np = (e^0.1 - 0.846) / (1"}
{"question": "George is seen to place an even-money $100,000 bet on the Bulls to win the NBA Finals. If George has a logarithmic utility-of-wealth function and if his current wealth is $1,000,000, what must he believe is the minimum probability that the Bulls will win?", "model_answer": "Reason: Since George's utility function is logarithmic, we know that the marginal utility of wealth is constant. This implies that he is risk-neutral. For a risk-neutral individual, the minimum probability required to accept an even-money bet is when the expected utility gain equals the utility loss from the potential loss. Given his initial wealth of $1,000,000 and the bet amount of $100,000, the break-even point occurs when the probability of winning is such that the expected gain equals the potential loss. Using the formula for expected value, we can calculate this probability. The expected gain from winning is $100,000 * p, where p is the probability of winning, and the potential loss from losing is $100,000. At the break-even point, these two values are equal, so we have $100,000 * p = $100,000. Solving for p gives us p = 1. However, since probability cannot exceed 1, we need to reconsider our approach. A risk-neutral individual would accept any positive probability of winning, but since George's utility function is logarithmic, he is actually risk-averse. For a risk-averse individual, the minimum probability required to accept an even-money bet is greater than 0."}
{"question": "Boy Alcott and Jon Buxton are partners in a steel company. They share the net income in proportion to their average investments. On January 1, Alcott invested $4,000 and Buxton invested $5,000. On May 1, Alcott invested an additional $2,000 and Buxton invested $1,750. On September 1, Alcott withdrew $500. On November 1, each partner invested an additional $2,000. The net profit for the year was $8,736. Find each partner's share of the profit.", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To calculate each partner's share of the profit, we need to determine their total investments over the year. Since they both invested an additional $2,000 on November 1, which balances out their previous withdrawals and additions, their average investments remain equal throughout the year. Therefore, they should share the profit equally."}
{"question": "TheAlforsCompany had a beginning inventory of $30,000, Jan 1, 1974. During the year, purchases amounted to $87,500, net sales to $102,000. Assuming that the gross profit rate is 40% of the net sales, what is the ending inventory using the gross profit method of inventory evaluation?", "model_answer": "Option: F; Reason: To calculate the ending inventory using the gross profit method, we first determine the gross profit by multiplying net sales by the gross profit rate (40% of $102,000 = $40,800). Then, we subtract the total cost of goods sold, which includes purchases plus the opening inventory ($87,500 + $30,000 = $117,500), from the gross profit to find the additional profit needed for the ending inventory. This additional profit is then added to the opening inventory to find the ending inventory. Therefore, the calculation is as follows: Ending Inventory = Opening Inventory + Additional Profit = $30,000 + ($40,800 - $117,500) = $30,000 + (-$76,700) = -$46,700. However, since inventory cannot be negative, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the cost of goods sold based on the gross profit percentage applied to the net sales, then subtracting this from the total revenue to find the gross profit, which is then used to calculate the ending inventory. The correct formula is: Gross Profit = Net Sales * Gross Profit Rate = $102,000 * 0.4 = $40,800; Cost of Goods Sold = Purch"}
{"question": "(a) Given the two discount series of 30-10-2(1/2) % and 25-15-2%, which is better? (b) Given the discount series 15-15% and the single rate of 30%, which is better?", "model_answer": "Let's analyze each part of the question step by step. For part (a), we need to compare the two discount series 30-10-2(1/2)% and 25-15-2%. To determine which series is better, let's calculate their total discounts. For the first series, the total discount is 30 + 10 + 1 = 41%. For the second series, the total discount is 25 + 15 + 2 = 42%. Since 42% is greater than 41%, the second series 25-15-2% is better.\n\nFor part (b), we compare the discount series 15-15% with the single rate of 30%. Again, calculating the total discount for the series gives us 15 + 15 = 30%. Since this equals the single rate of 30%, they are equally beneficial.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answers for parts (a) and (b) are D and E respectively. However, since the question asks for a single best option that covers both parts, we need to find a common ground. Option G states that the series 25-15-2% is better, and the series 15-15% and the single rate"}
{"question": "On July 7, Magee Data stock sold at a high of 23(1/8) and a low of 22(5/8). Giant Industrials sold for a high of 24(1/4) and a low of 23(1/2). Mr. Taylor purchased 300 shares of Magee Data at the high of the day and 400 shares of Giant Industrials at the low of the day. What was the cost of his purchase?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of shares by the price per share for each stock. For Magee Data, 300 shares were bought at 23(1/8), which is equivalent to 23.125. The total cost for Magee Data is 300 * 23.125 = $6,937.50. For Giant Industrials, 400 shares were bought at 23.5, so the total cost is 400 * 23.5 = $9,400. Adding these together gives us $6,937.50 + $9,400 = $16,337.50. However, this calculation does not match any option directly, indicating a miscalculation in the initial assessment. Let's reevaluate the correct approach. Since the initial calculation led to a different option, let's reassess the math step by step again. For Magee Data, 300 shares at 23(1/8) equals 300 * 23.125 = $6,937.50. For Giant Industrials, 400 shares at 23.5 equals 400 * 23.5 = $9,400. The total should be $6"}

{"question": "Janet Firestone purchased an option on a stock for $175 giving her the right to buy 100 shares at 14(1/2) within 90 days. One month later, she exercised her option and then sold the stock on the same day for 17. What was her profit on the stock?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: Janet bought the option for $175 and sold the stock for $1700, so her profit is $1700 - $175 = $525, but since she only had the right to buy 100 shares, we need to calculate the profit per share first. The cost price per share is 14.5 and the selling price per share is 17, so the profit per share is 17 - 14.5 = $2.5. Since she bought 100 shares, her total profit is 100 * $2.5 = $250, but this is not among the options, so let's recheck our calculation. We made a mistake earlier, the correct profit per share is 17 - 14.5 = $2.5, and since she bought 100 shares, her total profit is indeed 100 * $2.5 = $250, which is still not among the options, so let's reevaluate again. We calculated the profit per share correctly as $2.5, and since she bought 100 shares, her total profit should be 100 * $2.5 = $250, but this is not among the options, so let's review once more.

{"question": "Margaret Denault recently rented a truck to drive 516 miles in days and 17 hours, using 54 gallons of gasoline. The rental company charged her $32 per day, $.22 per mile, and $.445 per gal-lon of gas. Extra hours were charged $2.75 per hour. Find the total cost of the rental.", "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step. Let's denote the number of days as 'd' and the extra hours as 'h'. We know that Margaret drove for d + (17/24) days since she used 54 gallons of gasoline. Since we don't have the exact number of days, let's express everything in terms of 'd' first. The distance covered is 516 miles, so we can write the equation: 516 = 24d + 17. Solving for 'd', we get d = 21.0833. However, since we cannot rent a fraction of a day, we'll round up to 22 days. Now, let's calculate the total cost. The cost for days is 32 * 22 = $704. The cost for miles is 0.22 * 516 = $113.52. The cost for gasoline is 0.445 * 54 = $24.03. Finally, the cost for extra hours is 2.75 * 17 = $46.625. Adding these costs together, we get the total cost: 704 + 113.52 + 24.03 + 46.625 = $888.275. However, this exceeds"}

What would the difference in the interest charge amount to if the bank used exact interest instead of bankers' interest?", "model_answer": "Option: B; Reason: When calculating interest using exact interest, we consider the actual number of days, which is 143 days. Using the formula for exact interest, A = P(1 + rt), where A is the amount after t days, P is the principal amount, r is the rate per day, and t is the time in days, we can calculate the interest accurately. On the other hand, bankers' interest rounds down to the nearest whole month, so for 143 days, it would be rounded to 90 days. This difference in calculation leads to a smaller interest charge when using bankers' interest. Since the interest rate is 6%, the daily rate is 6%/365 ≈ 0.0164. For 143 days, the exact interest is approximately $2,000 * 0.0164 * 143 ≈ $37.19, while bankers' interest for 90 days would be approximately $2,000 * 0.0164 * 90 ≈ $29.88. The difference is about $7.31, but since this is not among the options, we need to find the closest one, which is $0.25."}
{"question": "HarryHyppeis paid a straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour. If he works 9 hours a day in a six-day week, how much will he be paid?", "model_answer": "Option: G; Reason: To find Harry's daily pay, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours worked in a day, which is $2.89 * 9 = $26.01. Then, to find his weekly pay, we multiply his daily pay by the number of days worked in a week, which is $26.01 * 6 = $156.06. Rounding this to two decimal places gives us $156.06, but since none of the options match exactly, we need to consider the closest option, which is G."}
