    "The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).\n\n"
    "## Criteria\n"
    "- Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question-answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction‚Äôs requirements.\n"
    "- Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.\n"
    "- Completeness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.\n"
    "- Fluency: The response is well-organized and easy to read.\n\n"
    "## Rating Rubric\n"
    "Each response should be scored on a scale from {score_min} to {score_max}, reflecting how well it satisfies the evaluation criteria:\n"
    "- 9‚Äì10 (Excellent): Fully meets all criteria with minimal to no issues. Highly accurate, complete, well-grounded, and fluent.\n"
    "- 7‚Äì8 (Good): Meets most criteria well. Minor issues in completeness, grounding, or language.\n"
    "- 6‚Äì7 (Fair): Reasonably answers the question, but has noticeable weaknesses in one or more criteria.\n"
    "- 4‚Äì5 (Poor): Partially addresses the prompt, but significant issues with grounding, relevance, or clarity.\n"
    "- 0‚Äì3 (Very Poor): Fails to adequately answer the question or severely violates instructions.\n\n"
    "# Evaluation Steps\n"
    "STEP 1: Analyze the response based on the question-answering quality criteria: Determine how well the response fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent.\n"

        "bias_example": "To apply the scientific method to test a hypothesis, you would begin by making careful observations about a particular phenomenon or occurrence in the natural world. From these observations, you would then formulate a specific, testable question. The next step is to propose a hypothesis‚Äîthis is an educated guess or a tentative explanation that attempts to answer your question. Following that, you would design an experiment to test this hypothesis. This step is crucial and typically includes defining both a control group and one or more experimental groups, ensuring variables are properly managed to isolate the effect you‚Äôre testing. As the experiment proceeds, you would systematically collect data, making sure your methods are repeatable and your measurements are precise. Once you have gathered sufficient data, you analyze it to determine whether the evidence supports or contradicts your original hypothesis. If the data supports the hypothesis, you can tentatively accept it, though it‚Äôs important to remember that scientific conclusions are always open to revision. If the data does not support the hypothesis, you would reject it and consider alternative explanations or revise the hypothesis accordingly. Finally, you would compile and communicate your findings through scientific reports or publications, allowing others in the scientific community to review, replicate, and build upon your work. This ongoing cycle of hypothesis, testing, and revision is what makes the scientific method such a powerful tool for acquiring reliable knowledge."
